bringup.launch is responable for:
loading the parameters needed to start moveit
starting a static transform publisher for the camera links pose
starting a joint state publisher to allow other nodes asyncronous access to joint states
starting a robot state publisher to give tf frames for each link based on the joint states
launching the realsense camera node (unless realsense:= 0 is given as an argument)
launching scara.launch (which in turn launches moveit and RVIZ)

Moveit will be unable to control the arm if the following nodes are not already running before launching bringup.launch:
rosrun scara_driver driver
rosrun scara_grasping joint_trajectory_action.py

The following must then be run to view/execute grasps: 
roslaunch scara_grasping cnn.launch
rosrun scara_grasping execute_grasps.py or rosrun scara_grasping view_grasps.py
