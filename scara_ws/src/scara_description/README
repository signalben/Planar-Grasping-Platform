The scara description package contains:

-STl files for each link of the scara arm and gripper

-The URDF describing the kinematics scara arm and gripper
	Upon this URDF moveit depends for control of the arm and RVIZ depends for visualization of the STL files.
	The URDF was automatically created by the SolidWorks to URDF Exporter- Originally created by Stephen Brawner (brawner@gmail.com), http://wiki.ros.org/sw_urdf_exporter
