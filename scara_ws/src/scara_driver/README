The scara driver package provides an interface between ROS and the controllers for the manipulator and gripper.

The driver node requires a device connected to /dev/ttyUSB0 to run, and will not tolerate disconnection of the device whilst running.
However, the positions of the arm are stored by GRBL, so the driver node may be restarted without losing the position of the arm.

The user node is primarily for debugging/inspection of the microcontrollers via serial.
However, it is required to manually enable and home the arm on startup with '&E' and '#$H'
