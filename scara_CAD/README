These folders contain the deign for all the mechanical components of the grasping platform.
The Solidworks parts and assemblies are present, but not the STLs used to 3D print them.

The main manipulator with gripper assembly is: 
manipulator/arm.SLDASM

The gripper and camera mounts are the following subassemblies:
gripper/gripper.SLDASM
realsenseD415_mount/realsense_mount.SLDASM

Designs produced to mount the endstop switches, electronics, and to test the grippers force are also included:
