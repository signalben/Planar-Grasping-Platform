gripper.ino is designed for use on a Arduino Nano.

It has 4 main purposes:
	1-Pass serial communication recieved on port0 (PC) to port1 (Arduino Mega running GRBl)
	2-Pass feedback from GRBl to PC
	3-Control the gripper as specified by PC
	4-Pass feedback from the gripper to PC

Since the Nano has only one hardware serial port, AltSoftSerial is used for port1.

The main loop simply checks port0 and port1 for incoming mesages. Messages from GRBL are forwarded to the PC.
Messages from the PC are either passed to GRBL, or interpreted as a gripper command (depnding on prefix # or &) 
Gripper commands may (depending on prefixes C,D,L,H,S,P)
	E -enable communication with the gripper and arm
	C -control the gripper using PID to a specified position
	D -disable communication with the gripper and arm
	L -report the minimum safe sensor value
	H -report the maximum safe sensor value
	S -report the current sensor value
	P -close the gripper using a constant PWM value
