GRBL is used for low-level control of the scara arm by an Arduino Mega.
This existing software has not been modified, other than setting configuration parameters

To flash GRBL onto an Arduino Mega2560:
	-in the Arduino IDE, open grbl-Mega-4axis-4axis/grbl/examples/grblUpload.ino
	-compile & upload only grblUpload.ino, it pulls in everything else
